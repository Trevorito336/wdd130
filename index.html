        Hey everybody, my name is Trevor Davis and I am very excited to be taking this course!
        I have been here at <strong>BYUi</strong> for a year now and I am studying Computer Science with a Minor in
        Music! I was born in Sandy, Utah but I grew up in a small place in Washington called Tri-Cities.
        One of my favorite hobbies is music. I love playing, listening, and writing music! I mainly play the piano and
        the saxophone, but I can also play most other woodwind instruments. I have been in one of the Jazz Bands up here
        at BYUi every semester and the last two I made our top Jazz Band, Sound Alliance, playing the Tenor Sax. I have
        been playing piano since the 2nd grade and the saxophone since the 5th grade and I haven't really gotten bored
        with either yet so here we are haha.
